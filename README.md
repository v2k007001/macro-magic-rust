## 🔮 Function Descriptions

The **Rust Macros Masterpack** turns arcane Rust macro syntax into pure code elegance. Here’s how:

- **`smart_enum!`**  
  Simplifies enum definitions, injecting display, conversion, and matching traits all at once. Perfect for rapid backend REST APIs!
- **`auto_struct!`**  
  Compose complex structures in a blink, automatically implementing builder patterns and serde traits.
- **`ai_macro!`**  
  Connects with the OpenAI API (or Claude alternative) directly from your codebase, allowing prompt-driven code generation inline in your Rust projects.
- **`multi_lang_export!`**  
  Instantly expands any struct or function for multi-language support—switch between Locales dynamically.
- **`theme_aware!`**  
  Write your UI logic once—our macro ensures your interface flows with the user’s light/dark OS theme. Ergonomics meets aesthetics!

Each macro is dressed up with doc-comments and a fun example, letting you onboard new developers with zero friction—ideal for SEO-conscious teams aiming for continuous velocity.
